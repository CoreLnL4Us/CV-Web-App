Web application dedicated to learning OpenCV through user interaction. 
Will support: User logins, Local Video access and previous data retrieval. 
Current Action Plan: 

0) Set up Git group

1) Class-ifying the python code
	a) Code review 
	b) Breaking down method into sub-methods (reusable code)
	c) Breaking down in to classes

2) HTML Template for web app
	a) user form - > creation and login
	b) video form -> select and description

3) DB design 
	a) What needs to be stored? (users, video_data)
	b) Relational tables

4) Integrate HTML with DB
	a) Be able to upload, insert, select into tables
	b) Through flask? Are there other options?

5) Get OpenCV classes to run through web
	a) Video displays on webpage. User is able to interact with video (click).
